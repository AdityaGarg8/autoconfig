The ISPDB, Thunderbird's database of mail configuration files.

There are two main branches: `master` and `prod`.

The https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net server will update when the `prod` branch is pushed.
The stage server at https://autoconfig-stage.thunderbird.net will update when the `master` branch is pushed.

Changes will affect account creation for all Thunderbird users, so be careful.
